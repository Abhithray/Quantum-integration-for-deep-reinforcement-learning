# Quantum-integration-for-deep-reinforcement-learning

This project explores the integration of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to enhance anomaly detection in network traffic datasets. By leveraging quantum circuits alongside classical RL agents, the framework aims to improve accuracy, efficiency, and generalization in cybersecurity use cases.
